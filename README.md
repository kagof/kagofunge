# kagofunge
![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/kagof/kagofunge/test.yml)


An interpreter & debugger written in Go for the Befunge-93 esoteric programming language.

This was mainly done as a pet project to get more familiar with Go, so please use with caution.

## Building

This project is written in Go 1.23. To compile it into the current directory, simply run:
```sh
go build
```

or to compile it and add it to your `$GOPATH/bin`:

```sh
go install
```

You may optionally want to link it to a shorthand `kgf` if you (for some reason) are using it frequently. This can be done with the following.

On a unix based system:
```sh
ln -s $(go env GOPATH)/bin/kagofunge $(go env GOPATH)/bin/kgf
```

In PowerShell on Windows:
```pwsh
$GOPATH = (go env GOPATH)
New-Item -Path "$GOPATH\bin\kgf.exe" -ItemType SymbolicLink -Target "$GOPATH\bin\kagofunge.exe"
```

### Dependencies

The only non-stdlib direct dependencies of this program are:

* [`github.com/fatih/color v1.18.0`](https://github.com/fatih/color) used to color the debugger output
* [`github.com/spf13/cobra v1.8.1`](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) used for the CLI
* [`github.com/stretchr/testify v1.10.0`](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) used for assertions in tests

## Usage

`kagofunge` is an interpreter and debugger for Befunge-93 written in Go.
For detailed usage, use `kagofunge run --help` or `kagofunge debug --help`.

```sh
kagofunge <run|debug> <program> [flags]
```

### Examples

```sh
kagofunge run hello-world.bf
kagofunge run '<> #,:# _@#:"Hello, World!"' -I
kagofunge run hello-world.bf -o output.txt -i input.txt
```

```sh
kagofunge debug hello-world.bf --breakpoint "(0,0)"
kagofunge debug '<> #,:# _@#:"Hello, World!"' -I -b 0,0 -b 8,0
kagofunge debug hello-world.bf -o output.txt -i input.txt -b '[1,1]'
```

### Debugging

There is a Terminal based debugger which can be used to step through the program, see the state of the code and the stack, and generally see how a Befunge-93 program is executing.

## Testing

The Go test suite can be executed by running

```sh
go test ./...
```

## About Befunge

Befunge-93 is an esoteric programming language created by [cpressey](https://catseye.tc/). It is a stack-based language operating on a two-dimensional plane (technically a torus) where the program counter's direction is determined by certain control characters (`>`, `^`, `<`, `v`). Other control characters include conditional directions (`|`, `_`), and skips (`#`). It also allows for modification of the code at runtime (`p`), which can lead to interesting results. To learn more, the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge) has a good summary of how the language operates.

Note that although the spec for Befunge-93 states that the program should only be 80x25, this interpreter does not impose such a restriction (which seems to be common among other implementations as well).

An example "Hello World" program in Befunge-93 can look like:

```Befunge
>               v
v"Hello, World!"<
> #,:# _@
```
The program counter starts in the upper left, then is directed down and moves right-to-left through the second row. `"` turns on "string mode" so the characters in `Hello, World!` get added to the stack backwards. `"` turns string mode off again. Finally, `> #,:# _@` is an outputting loop, printing all values on the stack as ASCII until the stack is empty, at which point the program terminates.

### Funge-98

There is also a more ambitious spec for Funge-98, which defines many more control characters, uses a stack of stacks, and allows for different dimensional "funges" (unefunge, trefunge, etc). This is much more difficult to implement and also doesn't have as well defined behaviour as Befunge-93, so I've limited this project to the 93 spec.
